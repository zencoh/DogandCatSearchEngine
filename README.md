# Dog and Cat Search Engine

## Description
This application is a webpage that helps the user choose a furry companion. This group was motivated to do this project because we all have a soft spot for pets in our hearts and we wanted to help additional people to find a pet that fits there lifestyle. In creating this application we learned how to use a CSS framework that is not bootstrap, became comfortable using fetch to pull data from API's, and the area we all saw the most growth with is getting comfortable with GitHub's work flow. This application forced all of us to get out of our comfort zone and try to expand our knowledge without guidance from instructors, giving a more workplace environment feeling.

## User Story
As a user I want to search for Dog and Cat breeds so that I can try to find my perfect companion.

## Wireframe
This is what we attempted to make our webpage look like.
